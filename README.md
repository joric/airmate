# IR Sender

A small ESP12f (ESP8266)-based project for DIY IR controller

## Description

There are a few type of IR codes I couldn't make short (32-bit NEC) codes work on my devices so I went with raw ones (long sequences of numbers) sent at 38 KHz.

Use IRController (originally from https://github.com/mdhiggins/ESP8266-HTTP-IR-Blaster) with NodeMCU and IR receiver to capture IR codes (usually RAW with length 48).
Use IRSender with ESP12F and IR LED for sending the codes. See scripts directory for scripts.

IR modules are from 37-in-1 sensors set. 3.3V regulator module is AMS1117-based.
NodeMCU modules might be a nicer choice (built in UART and 3.3V regulator) but they're more expensive than raw esp8266 modules.

**WARNING: never power ESP8266 from 5V, always use 3.3V or the module dies in a about a week (confirmed!)**
